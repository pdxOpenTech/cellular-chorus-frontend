## Setup instructions
This project uses Gatsby. To set up your developer environment for Gatsby, follow [these instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/). You can skip the "Create a Gatsby Site" section, since this already is one 🙃.

Once your developer environment is set up:
`git clone git@github.com:jaronheard/cellular-chorus-frontend.git`

`gatbsy develop`

## Audio files
This project is set up to use mp3 audio files named with the hex codes of the associated color. These files are stored in the `src/audio` directory.
